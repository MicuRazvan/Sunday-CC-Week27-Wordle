# Sunday CC Week27 Wordle

## Context
I lost a bet with a friend and he challenged me that for the next 52 weeks, during weekends I need to create from scratch a new project.

For this week, we decided to build a Wordle game using Spring. I'm allowed to work on it only Sunday.

## The rules are the following:
*   Each Friday night, me and him will talk about what project I need to do.
*   Mostly he will decide for me, but I’m allowed to suggest and do my own ideas if he agrees on them.
*   Once the project is decided, he will tell me if I’m allowed to work Saturday and Sunday, or only Sunday.
(Surely this won’t backfire at some point by underestimating a project, right? 😅)

## About the project
More information about the game and rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle

### How to run:
1.  Compile and run the Spring Boot application.
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

### How to play:
*   Use the buttons below the game grid to type words.
*   Press "ENTER" button to send the word and see the progress.
*   **New Game**: Available immediately after a win or loss.
